<h1>Learn More About Native Plants</h1>
<!--from one Humboldt County resident to another-->

<h4>What are native plants?</h4>
<p>
Native plants are those that grow naturally in a specific region. A prime example in Humboldt County is the iconic redwood tree. Redwoods are a native plant and have evolved specifically for the soil, climate and wildlife of this region. The only place in the world that redwood trees grow naturally is along the coast of California and southern Oregon. But the redwood is only one of hundreds of species of native plants found in Humboldt County.

<h4>Ecological Benefits of native plants.</h4>
<p>
Plants are the foundation of our delicate ecosystems. Native plants provide critical forage and shelter for insects and local wildlife. When it comes to plants, insects are selective and can't use just any plant. Each native species has a unique symbiotic relationship with the insects that depend on it. The birds and other wildlife depends on these insects and native plants for their survival.

<h4>Ideal for Landscaping</h4>
<p>
Native plants are naturally adapted to this region and require very little maintanence. Native plants need no water once established, thereby making them extremely drought-friendly. There is also no need for the soil amendments, pesticides, herbicides that abound in traditional lawns and gardens.

<p>Native Plants are Low-Maintenance</p>
<p>
Native plants are naturally low-maintenance. We can attempt to mimic conditions for non-native species with soil amendments and specific watering schedules. But there are plants that thrive in our soil conditions and weather, because they have evolved to do so.
