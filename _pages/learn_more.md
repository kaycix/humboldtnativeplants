<h1>Learn More About Native Plants</h1>
<!--from one Humboldt County resident to another-->

<h4>What are native plants?</h4>
<p>
Native plants are those that grow naturally in a specific region. A prime example in Humboldt County is the iconic redwood tree. Redwoods are a native plant and have evolved specifically for the soil, climate and wildlife of this region. The only place in the world that redwood trees grow naturally is along the coast of California and southern Oregon. But the redwood is only one of hundreds of species of native plants found in Humboldt County.

<p>Native Plants are Low-Maintenance</p>

Native plants are naturally low-maintenance. We can attempt to mimic conditions for non-native species with soil amendments and specific watering schedules. But there are plants that thrive in our soil conditions and weather, because they have evolved to do so.
