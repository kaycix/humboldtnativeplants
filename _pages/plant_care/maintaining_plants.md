Potted plants need regular care and attention to help them grow healthy, good looking plants. We need to cut off old/diseased leaves, remove moss and lungwort, pull weeds, and remove old roots if the plant becomes pot-bound or else divide it.

We should regularly check plants for diseases and pests. For diseases, we need to start by removing any diseased parts carefully, placing them in the green waste or trash container. If removing specific sections of the plant(s) doesn’t solve the problem, we need to isolate the plant(s) to further determine what is going on and how to move forward with the problem plant(s). If we are unable to get rid of the disease, we should dispose of the plant by placing the plant(s) into the green waste container, minus any soil that should go in our soil compost. Pruners should be sterilized before being used again by using alcohol in a sprayer. Thoroughly remove any dirt residue from the pruners and then spray all surfaces with a sterilizing spray.

For plant pests, first isolate the plant(s) from other plants around it. Next, determine what pest is impacting the plant(s). Then find the appropriate, less toxic way to deal with the pest, such as trying to get aphids off plants with a stream of water. After treatment, keep the plant(s) in isolation until all evidence of infestation is gone. The plant(s) very likely need to be cleaned up, leaves & stems removed after a pest infestation. Pruners should be sterilized before being used again by using alcohol in a sprayer. Thoroughly remove any dirt residue from the pruners and then spray all surfaces with a sterilizing spray. 
Removing old leaves - remove old leaves and stems that are no longer productive or look good. Using clean, sterilized pruners, remove any old leaves, placing them in a refuse container. Once your container is full, place the leaves into the green waste. Look for any signs of disease while you are working on the plant either on the leaves or on the stems. Remove any of it as above. Always sterilize your pruners between species so you don’t spread any diseases. Sterilize as above.

Root-bound plants - Root-bound pots will either dry out much sooner than other plants or will show roots coming out of the bottom. Remove the plant and place it on a tray. Using a sterilized knife or sharp cutters, cut off 2-3 inches of the lower portion of the plant, cut or loosen side roots if necessary, and put in green waste. Put new potting soil in the bottom of the container, place the plant back into the pot, ensuring that the plant’s soil surface is ½” from the top of the container. If not, add more soil to
the bottom of the container and replace the plant. Compact the soil around the plant, removing any oxygen from the soil. Water the plant in well, and fertilize.

Dividing Plants – some plants, such as California Aster, Yarrow, Piggy-back, Sugar Scoop, Miterwort, Coltsfoot, Erythranthe (Mimulus) guttata & Erythranthe (Mimulus) cardinalis, can be easily divided for propagation purposes or if the plant becomes too crowded in the 1-gallon container. To divide a plant, take it out of its container, placing it on a tray. Take a clean sterilized knife and cut the plant into the desired number of pieces, usually quarters or more. Place each division into a new 1-gallon container, adding the needed amount of soil to the bottom first and then around the division. Press the soil around the division to compact it. Water well and fertilize with time release fertilizer. Add a label or record on the “Labels Needed” list how many labels you need. If we already have enough plant starts, put what is not needed into the green waste.
