            Conservation at Home

            <p>
            Humboldt Native Plants' mission is to empower people to participate in conservation in their own backyards and neighborhoods. Even a small native garden can have a big impact to native species, as part of a larger web of restored land. 
            Our ultimate goal is to unite our community in biodiversity conservation for current and future generations.

If you have ever felt helpless or overwhelmed by the ongoing news or the drought and climate crisis, don't let it overpower you. Let it fuel you. There are things you can do today to make a difference. There are people you can connect to today who feel the same way. Let us hold each other up, and help one another. Don't give in to grief, there is still so much of nature's beauty around us to save.
