The CNPS native plant demonstration garden was created in 2019 by sustainable landscape designer Christine Kelly, with the help of CNPS nursery and Helping Humboldt volunteers. It occupies a corner of the CNPS nursery and represents 6 ecosystems of Humboldt County. It is a valuable demonstration of what homeowners can accomplish on a small suburban lot. Visitors can view the garden during Volunteer Hours. Walking through the nursery also allows visitors a behind-the-scenes glimpse of this extensive native plant nursery.
<br/>*The plant list is currently being updated. Check back soon!*"
